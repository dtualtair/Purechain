# Purechain

**Purechain** is a fully open-source blockchain-based solution designed to bring transparency, immutability, and traceability to supply chains – especially those involving agriculture, food, and product safety. By leveraging JavaScript for its architecture and MIT licensing, Purechain is simple to deploy, audit, and extend for a variety of blockchain-powered traceability and provenance use cases.

## 🌱 Overview

Modern supply chains are complex, involving multiple stakeholders (farmers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers) and vulnerable to fraud, mislabeling, and breakdowns in traceability. Purechain addresses these issues by providing a decentralised ledger where every transfer, transformation, or inspection of a product is recorded transparently and securely.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Decentralised Ledger:** Every transaction, transfer, and product update is recorded as a new block on the Purechain blockchain, linked to all previous records.
- **Transparency & Traceability:** All participants can audibly track the full provenance and journey of an item—from origin to consumer.
- **Data Integrity:** Immutability and cryptographic validation ensure no party can tamper with historical data.
- **Smart Contracts:** Use programmable logic for automating record-keeping, compliance, and conditional transfers (where implemented).
- **Stakeholder Roles:** Distinct identities for farmers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers—each with permission-based data access.
- **MIT Licensed:** Fully open source, usable and modifiable for both research and commercial projects.
- **Simple, JS-based:** Built entirely in JavaScript, straightforward to run in Node.js or front-end environments, and suitable for educational demos and real-world pilots.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dtualtair/Purechain.git
cd Purechain
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Run the application**  
*For a simple example (see app.js or main.js for demo use):*

```bash
node app.js
# or
node main.js
```

4. **Explore and customize**
- Add your own supply chain events
- Adjust participant types/roles and permissions
- Extend the data recorded in each block

├── blockchain.js        # Core blockchain logic—Block, Blockchain classes
├── app.js / main.js     # Entry point with demo/test logic
├── participants.js      # Stakeholder definitions (Farmer, Distributor, etc.)
├── data/                # Demo/test data if provided
├── package.json         # Dependencies and scripts
└── README.md            # Documentation
```

## 🛡️ Security & Data Integrity

- Uses hashing (e.g., SHA256 via crypto or crypto-js) to secure block data and chain links
- Optionally supports digital signatures for authenticated transactions
- Tamper-evident: Any block modification breaks the entire chain
- Immutability: Enforced by the blockchain structure and validation logic

---

## 🌍 Use Cases

- **Food & Agriculture:** Trace origin, processing, and distribution of perishable goods
- **Pharmaceuticals:** Track batches and prevent counterfeiting
- **Luxury Goods:** Guarantee authenticity and detect gray-market items
- **Any Supply Chain:** Verify authenticity, transparency, and regulatory compliance
